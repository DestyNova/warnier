# Warnier

Tool for generating and editing [Warnier/Orr diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnier/Orr_diagram), which are a neat tool for thinking about and designing programs. They're also pretty oldschool, and I've never seen anyone else use them in real life.

The tool does absolutely nothing yet, but I plan to add support for:

* Interactively creating, editing and exploring diagrams
* Exporting / importing from JSON
* Maybe SVG/PDF/PNG export?

It'll probably remain fully client-side.
